<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective date: __________</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>App Name</strong> ("the App", "we", "us", or "our")
handles information when you use the App.
</p>

<p>
The App is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, or sell
user personal data or message content.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

<p>
We do not collect or have access to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Message content or attachments</li>
  <li>Encryption keys</li>
  <li>Contact lists</li>
  <li>Message metadata such as message history or conversations</li>
  <li>Precise location data</li>
</ul>

<p>
All messages are end-to-end encrypted using the Double Ratchet protocol and can only be
decrypted on the recipient’s device.
</p>

<h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>

<p>
All user data, including messages, cryptographic keys, and related information,
is stored locally on your device and remains encrypted at rest.
</p>

<p>
We do not have the ability to access or recover this data.
</p>

<h2>3. Temporary Server Processing</h2>

<p>
In situations where a direct peer-to-peer connection is unavailable,
encrypted messages may be temporarily relayed through our servers
to enable delivery.
</p>

<p>
During this process:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Messages remain encrypted at all times</li>
  <li>No message content can be read or decrypted by us</li>
  <li>Messages are automatically deleted immediately after delivery or
      after a maximum of 48 hours if delivery fails</li>
</ul>

<p>
No long-term server-side storage or backups of messages are maintained.
</p>

<h2>4. Signaling Data</h2>

<p>
The App uses a signaling server to exchange technical connection information
required to establish peer-to-peer WebRTC connections.
</p>

<p>
Signaling data is limited to what is necessary for connection setup
and does not include message content.
</p>

<h2>5. Log Data</h2>

<p>
To maintain the stability and security of the service, minimal technical
log data may be processed, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymous error reports</li>
  <li>Server performance metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such data is not used to identify individual users and is retained
only for as long as necessary for operational purposes.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs,
or data brokers.
</p>

<p>
Network infrastructure providers may process encrypted data solely
for the purpose of data transmission.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Security</h2>

<p>
We implement technical and organizational measures designed to
protect the App’s infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
However, no method of electronic communication or storage
can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Changes become effective when published.
</p>
