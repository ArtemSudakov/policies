<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p class="muted">Effective date: __________</p>

<p>
These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the mobile application
<strong>App Name</strong> (the "App"), operated by <strong>Company Name</strong> ("we", "us", or "our").
</p>

<p>
By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>

<p>
The App is a peer-to-peer messaging service designed to enable secure communication between users.
Communication is primarily established directly between user devices using WebRTC technology.
</p>

<p>
In cases where a direct peer-to-peer connection is temporarily unavailable, encrypted messages may be
relayed through the App’s servers solely for delivery purposes.
</p>

<h2>2. End-to-End Encryption</h2>

<p>
All messages sent through the App are protected using end-to-end encryption based on the Double Ratchet protocol.
Messages are encrypted on the sender’s device and can only be decrypted on the recipient’s device.
</p>

<p>
We do not have access to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Message contents</li>
  <li>Encryption keys</li>
  <li>Attachments or media in decrypted form</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are technically unable to read, intercept, or decrypt user messages.
</p>

<h2>3. Temporary Message Relay and Retention</h2>

<p>
When messages are relayed via the server, they are stored only in encrypted form and only for as long as necessary
to complete delivery.
</p>

<p>
Encrypted messages are automatically deleted from the server:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immediately after successful delivery, or</li>
  <li>After a maximum of 48 hours if delivery is not completed</li>
</ul>

<p>
No message backups or long-term server-side storage are maintained.
</p>

<h2>4. Signaling Server</h2>

<p>
The App uses a signaling server solely to exchange technical connection metadata required to establish
peer-to-peer WebRTC connections.
</p>

<p>
Signaling data does not include message content and is not used to identify or track users beyond what
is technically required to establish a connection.
</p>

<h2>5. Local Data Storage</h2>

<p>
All message history, cryptographic keys, and related data are stored locally on the user’s device
and remain encrypted at rest.
</p>

<p>
If you delete the App or lose access to your device, your data cannot be recovered by us.
</p>

<h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
</p>

<p>
You agree not to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the App for unlawful purposes</li>
  <li>Attempt to interfere with the operation or security of the App</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>
The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind,
whether express or implied.
</p>

<p>
We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, absolute security, or error-free operation.
</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
special, or consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of the App.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>

<p>
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes become effective
constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>

<p>
You may stop using the App at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App
if these Terms are violated.
</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of __________,
without regard to its conflict of law principles.
